# This model initially had no columns defined.  If you add columns to the
# model remove the '{}' from the fixture names and add the columns immediately
# below each fixture, per the syntax in the comments below

  email: admin@email.com
  encrypted_password: <%= User.new.send(:password_digest, 'password') %>
  admin: true
#
